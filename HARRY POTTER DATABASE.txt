TABLE users(
  user_id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY,
  first_name TEXT NOT NULL,
  last_name TEXT,
  house TEXT);

TABLE follower(
  user_id INTEGER,
  follows INTEGER,
  date_created DATE
  );

Q.1 How many users are there in each house?

	select house, count(*) from users
		       group by house
	
Q2. List all following links that were created before September 1st, 1993

	select * from follows where date_created < '09-01-1993'

Q3. List all following links that were created before September 1st, 1993, specify first name

	select user_first_name, first_name as follows_first_name , date_created from users join

		(select first_name user_firstname,follows, date_created from users join follower on
							users.user_id=follower.user_id) T1
	on users.user_id=T1.follows
	where date_created < '09-01-1993'


Q4. Give a count of how many people followed each user as of 1999–12–31. Give the result in term of “user full name, number of followers”

	select concat(first_name,last_name) as full_name , count(*) as number_of_followers from users join follower 
												on users.user_id=follower.follows
												where date_created < '12-31-1991'
												group by full_name
												order by number_of_followers DESC

Q5. List the number of users each user follows

	select first_name , count(*) as number_of_followed from users join follower 
												on users.user_id=follower.user_id
												group by first_name 
												order by number_of_followed DESC

Q6. Select all rows from where user from one house follows someone from another house. Give first names and house of each 

	select user_name, user_house, first_name as follows_name, follows_house from users join

	(
	select first_name as user_name, follows, house as user_house from users join follower on
									     users.user_id=follower.user_id
	)T1
	on users.user_id=T1.follows
	and user_house!=follows_house

Q7. List all unrequited followings (i.e. where A follows B but B does not follow A)

	select user_name as person, follows_name as does_not_follow_back from
	(
	select user_name, follows_name, concat(T1.follows,uid ) as pair1   follows_house from users join

	(
	select first_name as user_name,users.user_id as uid, follows from users join follower on
									     users.user_id=follower.user_id
	)T1
	on users.user_id=T1.follows
	)T2
	where pair1 not in (select concat(follows,user_id) from follower)
