Q2. Quiet student

Write an SQL query to report the students (student_id, student_name) being 
“quiet” in ALL exams. A “quite” student is the one who took at least one exam and didn’t score neither 
the high score nor the low score.				      

select student_id, student_name from
(
select student_id, student_name, score, max(score) over(partition by exam_id) as min_score, min(score) over(partition by exam_id) as max_score
from student s join exam e
on s.student_id= exam.student_id
) t1
where (score!=max_score or score!=min_score)
