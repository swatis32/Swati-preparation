Q7. Write an SQL query to find employees who earn the top 
three salaries in each of the department. For the above tables, your SQL query should 
return the following rows (order of rows does not matter).	

select depatment, employee, salary from 
(
select e.name as employee, salary, d.name as department, dense_rank() over( partition by d.name order by salary DESC) as rnk from employee e
join department d
on e.departmentId=d.id
) t
where rnk <=3
