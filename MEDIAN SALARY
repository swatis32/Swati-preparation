suppose you're given a table with company name and salary
name salary
msft  100
goog  200
goog  100
...
...


create view v as select distinct(e.salary), count(*) as freq, e.name from emp e group by e.name, e.salary
this creates the following
salary      freq            name
100         1               fb
300         11              fb
1100        1               fb
100         5               goog
200         7               goog
300         1               goog
500         1               goog
600         1               goog
100         7               msft
200         1               msft
300         1               msft
400         1               msft
500         1               msft


there are 39 rows, hence 20th row would be median
19 + 1 + 19
select * from v order by salary

salary       freq   name
100             1   fb
100             5   goog
100             7   msft
200             7   goog ---> median is 200
200             1   msft
300             11  fb
300             1   goog
300             1   msft
400             1   msft
500             1   goog
500             1   msft
600             1   goog
1100            1   fb



now that we have a freq histogram view of the salaries - look at MedianOfNumbersGivenFrequency.txt if this is unclear!
select v.name, avg(v.salary) from v where v.freq >=
abs(
(select sum(v1.freq) from v v1 where v1.salary <= v.salary)
-
(select sum(v2.freq) from v v2 where v2.salary >= v.salary)
)

Some Ways to calculate median: 
Assume table is employee and column is salary for 1 and 2 
Assume table is employee and column is salary, frequency for 3


Frequency not provided
1. Select percentile_approx(salary, 0.5) from employee

2. 

With t1 as 

(select avg (salary) as result, ‘even’ as type from 

(Select salary, row_number()over( order by salary) as rnk from employee ) t1

Where rnk in ( select count(*)/2, count(*)/2+1 from employee)					)
Union all
select avg (salary) as result , ‘odd’ as type from 

	(Select salary, row_number()over( order by salary) as rnk from employee ) t1

						Where rnk in ( select (count(*)+1)/2 from employee)
)

Select case when mod(count (*),2)=0 then (select result from t1 where type=‘even’)
		else (select result from t1 where type=‘odd’)
		end as median
From employee 

3.
Frequency provided
Select max(salary) from

(Select salary , count(*) as n, sum(frequency) over (order by salary) as cumsum from employee)

Where cumsum <= n/2
