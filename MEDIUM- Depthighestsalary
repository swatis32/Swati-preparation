select d.Name as 'Department, e.Name as 'Employee', e.Salary as 'Salary' from Employee e left join Department d on e.DepartmentId=d.Id
group by e.DepartmentId order by Salary desc limit 1

### we form 3 tables employee, department and a custom table with (salary and departmentid), so its a cartisian product
### then we apply the conditions

select d.name as 'Department', e.name as 'Employee', e.salary as 'Salary' from employee e, department d,
(select max(salary) as 'Salary', e2.departmentid from employee e2 group by e2.departmentid) s
where d.id = e.departmentid and
e.salary = s.salary and
s.departmentid = e.departmentid
