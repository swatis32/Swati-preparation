Number  Freq
1        5
2        10
3        20

select  avg(n.Number) median
from Numbers n
where n.Frequency >= abs((select sum(Frequency) from Numbers where Number<=n.Number) -
                         (select sum(Frequency) from Numbers where Number>=n.Number))


what we're doing here is that we're taking the absolute difference of the sum of frequencies of numbers to the left and right

For 1 --> 1's freq 5 >= abs(5-35) -- is false, so 1 wont be a candidate for a median
For 2 --> 2's freq 10 >= abs(15-30) -- is false, so 2 wont be a candidate for a median
For 3 --> 3's freq 20 >= abs(35-20) -- is true, so 3 WILL be a candidate for a median
Since there is only 1 number '3' which is a candidate, we simply return 3 as the median
1,1,1,1,1,2,2.....10 times,3,3,3....20 times
here 3 will be median

Now imagine a case where you have
Number  Freq
1        1
2        1
3        1
4        1

For 1 --> 1's freq 1 >= abs(1-4) -- is false, so 1 wont be a candidate for a median
For 2 --> 2's freq 1 >= abs(2-3) -- is true, so 2 WILL be a candidate for a median
For 3 --> 3's freq 1 >= abs(3-2) -- is true, so 3 WILL be a candidate for a median
For 4 --> 4's freq 1 >= abs(4-1) -- is false, so 4 wont be a candidate for a median
Now we have 2 candidates for the median -- 2 and 3, so we average these two and return 2.5
1,2,3,4 --> median is 2.5
