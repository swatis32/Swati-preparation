In facebook, there is a follow table with two columns: followee, follower.

Please write a sql query to get the amount of each follower’s follower if he/she has one.

For example:

+-------------+------------+
| followee    | follower   |
+-------------+------------+
|     A       |     B      |
|     B       |     C      |
|     B       |     D      |
|     D       |     E      |
+-------------+------------+
should output:

+-------------+------------+
| follower    | num        |
+-------------+------------+
|     B       |  2         |
|     D       |  1         |
+-------------+------------+
Explaination:

Both B and D exist in the follower list, when as a followee, B’s follower is C and D, and D’s follower is E. A does not exist in follower list.

Note:

Followee would not follow himself/herself in all cases.

Please display the result in follower’s alphabet order.

Select follower, num from follow join
(Select followee as f, count(*) as num from follow group by followee) T1
On follow.follower=T1.f


-------------------------------------------------------

select distinct(f.follower), count(*) as num from follow f join follow f1 on
f1.followee = f.follower group by f.follower
order by f.follower asc

# we take each distinct followee who is also a follower [JOIN CONDITION ABOVE] (ie only B and D) and we count how many times they appear (number of rows of B and D as followees)


OR (Swatis) --- like this
Select f1.followee , count(*) as num from follow f1 
where f1.followee in (select distinct (f2.follower) from follow f2)
group by f1.followee 

(Swatis cleaner)
select table1.follower, table2.counts from
(select distinct(follower) from follow ) as table 1
join
(select folowee, count(followee) as counts from follow group by followee) as table 2
on table1.follower=table2.followee
order by table1.follower
