Table point_2d holds the coordinates (x,y) of some unique points (more than two) in a plane.
Write a query to find the shortest distance between these points rounded to 2 decimals.
| x  | y  |
|----|----|
| -1 | -1 |
| 0  | 0  |
| -1 | -2 |
The shortest distance is 1.00 from point (-1,-1) to (-1,2). So the output should be:
| shortest |
|----------|
| 1.00     |
Note: The longest distance among all the points are less than 10000.

SELECT
    ROUND(SQRT(MIN((POW(p1.x - p2.x, 2) + POW(p1.y - p2.y, 2)))), 2) AS shortest
FROM
    point_2d p1
        JOIN
    point_2d p2 ON p1.x != p2.x OR p1.y != p2.y  ### no 2 x coordinates can be the same, no 2 y coordinates can be the same
;

Note: - The condition 'p1.x != p2.x OR p2.y != p2.y' is to avoid calculating the distance of a point with itself. Otherwise, the minimum distance will be always zero.
