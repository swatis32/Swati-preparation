1. Cancellation rates
From the following table of user IDs, actions, and dates, write a query to return the publication and cancellation rate for each user.

My solution:

select T3.user_id, publish/total as publish_rate, cancel/total as cancel_rate from 

((select user_id, count(start) as total from users
group by user_id
having action='start) T1

join
(select user_id, count(action) as cancel from users
group by user_id
having cancel) T2
on T1.user_id=T2.user_id
) T3
join

(select user_id, count(action) as publish from users
group by user_id
having action='publish') T4
on T3.user_id=T4.user_id

good solution!!!!

select user_id, publish/starts as publish_rate, cancels/starts as cancel rate from
(select user_id,
	SUM(case when action='start' then 1 else 0 END ) as starts
	SUM(case when action='publish' then 1 else 0 END ) as publish
	SUM(case when action='cancel' then 1 else 0 END ) as cancels
	group by user_id) T1
