12. Hacker scores
Given the following two tables, write a query to return the hacker ID, name, and 
total score (the sum of maximum scores for each challenge completed) ordered by descending 
score, and by ascending hacker ID in the case of score tie. Do not display entries for hackers with a score of zero.


select hackers.hacker_id, name, sum(max_score) as total_score from hackers join
(
select hacker_id, challenge_id, max(score) as max_score from submissions
						group by hacker_id, challenge_id
)T1
on hackers.hacker_id=T1.hacker_id
group by hackers.hacker_id, name
having total_score >0
order by total_score DESC, hackers.hacker_id ASC

Updated :

Select hacker_id, name, sum(score) as total

From
(
Select hacker_id, name , challenge_id, dense_rank() over (partition by hacker_id, challenge_id order by score DESC) as rnk, score
From hackers join submissions
On hackers.hacker_id=submissions.hacker_id
) t1
Where rnk=1
And score > 0
Group by 1,2
Order by sum(score) DESC, hacker_id ASC
