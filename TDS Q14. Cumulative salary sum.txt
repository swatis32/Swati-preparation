The following table holds monthly salary information for several employees. Write a query
 to get, for each month, the cumulative sum of an employeeâ€™s salary over a period of 3 months, 
excluding the most recent month. The result should be ordered by ascending employee ID and month.

#### CLEVER SOLUTION WHERE THEY USED DESC IN RANK

select id, pay_month , salary , sum(salary) OVER( partition by id order by month_rank DESC) from

(select *, rank() OVER(partition by id order by pay_month DESC) as month_rank from employee)T1
where month_rank != 1
and month_rank <=4
order by id, pay_month
