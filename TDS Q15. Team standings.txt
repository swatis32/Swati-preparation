15. Team standings
Write a query to return the scores of each team in the teams table after all matches displayed in the matches table. Points 
are awarded as follows: zero points for a loss, one point for a tie, and three points for a win. 
The result should include team name and points, and be ordered by decreasing points. In case of a tie, order 
by alphabetized team name.

select team_name , sum(points) as total_points from
	(
	select team_name, case when host_goals > guest_goals then 3
		       	       when host_goals = guest_goals then 1
		       	       else 0 end as points
		  		from teams join matches
				on teams.team_id=matches.host_team
	UNION ALL
	select team_name, case when guest_goals > host_goals then 3
		       	       when guest_goals = host_goals then 1
		       	       else 0 end as points
		  		from teams join matches
				on teams.team_id=matches.guest_team
