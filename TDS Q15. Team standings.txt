15. Team standings
Write a query to return the scores of each team in the teams table after all matches displayed in the matches table. Points 
are awarded as follows: zero points for a loss, one point for a tie, and three points for a win. 
The result should include team name and points, and be ordered by decreasing points. In case of a tie, order 
by alphabetized team name.


select team_name, sum(goals) as total_score from teams join

(select host_team as team, host_score as goals from 
(select *, case when host_goals > guest_goals then 3
	       when host_goals = guest_goals then 1
		else 0 
		end as host_score,
	 case when guest_goals > host_goals then 3
	       when host_goals = guest_goals then 1
		else 0 
		end as guest_score) T2

union all
select guest_team as team, guest_score as goals from 
(select *, case when host_goals > guest_goals then 3
	       when host_goals = guest_goals then 1
		else 0 
		end as host_score,
	 case when guest_goals > host_goals then 3
	       when host_goals = guest_goals then 1
		else 0 
		end as guest_score) T3
