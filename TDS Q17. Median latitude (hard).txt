17. Median latitude (hard)
Write a query to return the median latitude of 
weather stations from each state in the following table, rounding to the nearest tenth of a degree


select state, AVG(latitude) from 

(select state,latitude rank() over(partition by state order by latitude) as rnk, count(*) over(partition by state) as counts from stations)
where rnk>=counts/2 and rnk <=counts/2+1
group by state

--------------------------------------------------------------
if n is odd, X[(n+1)/2] is median
if n is even avg (X[n/2], X[n/2]+1 is median

Select state, median_latitude from 
(
Select state , AVG(latitude) as median_latitude
(Select state, latitude, row_number()(partition by state order by latitude descent) as rnk, count(*)over(partition by state) as cnt from stations)t1
Where rnk in (cnt/2, cnt/2+1)
And mod(cnt,2)=0
group by 1
Union all
Select state , AVG( latitude) as median_latitude
(Select state, latitude, row_number()(partition by state order by latitude descent) as rnk, count(*)over(partition by state) as cnt from stations)t2
Where rnk=(cnt+1)/2
And mod(cnt,2) !=0
group by 1
)

On the whole list:

select cast(avg(lat_n) AS decimal(10,4)) from
(select lat_n, RANK() OVER(order by lat_n) as rnk from station)T1
where rnk>=(select count(*)/2 from station)
and rnk<=(select (count(*)/2)+1 from station)
