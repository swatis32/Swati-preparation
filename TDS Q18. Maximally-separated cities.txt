18. Maximally-separated cities
From the same table in question 17, write a query to return the 
furthest-separated pair of cities for each state, and the corresponding 
distance (in degrees, rounded to 2 decimal places) between those two cities

select state, city1, city2, dist from
(
select T1.state, T1.city as city1, T2.city as city2 , ROUND(SQRT(SUM(POWER((T1.latitude-T2.latitude),2),POWER((T1.longitude-T2.longitude),2))),2) as dist, 
rank() OVER(partition by T1.state order by ROUND(SQRT(SUM(POWER((T1.latitude-T2.latitude),2),POWER((T1.longitude-T2.longitude),2))),2) DESC) as rnk

																		from stations T1
																	 	join stations T2
																		on T1.state=T2.state and T1.city!=T2.city
)T3
where rnk=1
