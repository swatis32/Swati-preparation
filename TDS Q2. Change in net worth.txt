2. Changes in net worth
From the following table of transactions between two users, write a query to return the change in net worth for each user, ordered by decreasing net change.
My solution:

select T2.receiver, (received-sent) as nw from

(select sender, amount as sent from transactions
group by sender) T1

join

(select receiver, amount as received from transactions
group by receiver)
on T1.sender=T2.receiver
order by nw DESC
