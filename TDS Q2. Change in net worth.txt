2. Changes in net worth
From the following table of transactions between two users, write a query to return the change in net worth for each user, ordered by decreasing net change.
My solution:


Select user, nw from 
(
Select user, sum(amount) over(partition by user order by date) as nw, dense_rank() over(partition by user order by date DESC) as rank from
(
Select sender as user,  date, amount*-1 as amount from transact
union 
Select receiver as user, date, amount*-1 as amount from transact
)
) T1
Where rank=1
order by nw DESC
