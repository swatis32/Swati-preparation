2. Changes in net worth
From the following table of transactions between two users, write a query to return the change in net worth for each user, ordered by decreasing net change.
My solution:

select T2.receiver, (received-sent) as nw from

(select sender, amount as sent from transactions
group by sender) T1

join

(select receiver, amount as received from transactions
group by receiver)
on T1.sender=T2.receiver
order by nw DESC

---- Another way using window fucnction (not super efficent, but works)

Select user, nw from 
(
Select user, sum(amount) over(partition by user order by date) as nw, dense_rank() over(partition by user order by date DESC) as rank from
(
Select sender as user,  date, amount*-1 as amount from transact
union 
Select receiver as user, date, amount*-1 as amount from transact
)
) T1
Where rank=1
