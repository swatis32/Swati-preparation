21. Commonly purchased together
Using the following two tables, write a query to return the names 
and purchase frequency of the top three pairs of products most often
 bought together. The names of both products should appear in one column




select concat(T1.name,' ',T2.name) as product_pair, count(*) from 

(
select order_id, name from orders join products 
					on orders.product_id=products.id
)T1
join
(
select order_id, name from orders join products 
					on orders.product_id=products.id
)T2
on T1.order_id=T2.order_id and T1.name < T2.name # smart to avoid duplicates eg. A<B
group by product_pair
order by count(*) desc
LIMIT 3

------------------------- Another way -----------------
Select products, count(*) 

from
(
Select o1.order_id, concat (p1.name , p2.name ) as products from
Orders o1
Join
Orders o2
Join
products p1
Join 
products p2
On o1.order_id=o2.order_id
And o1.product_id!=o2.product_id
And o1.product_id=p1.product_id
And o2.product_id=p2.product_id
And p1.name <p2.name

) 
Group by 1
Order by count(*) DESC
LIMIT 3
