22. Average treatment effect (hard)
From the following table summarizing the results of a study, calculate 
the average treatment effect as well as upper and lower bounds 
of the 95% confidence interval. Round these numbers to 3 decimal places.


select treat_mean-control_mean as point_estimate, (treat_mean-control_mean)- 1.96*(control_std^2/control_size+ treat_std^2/treat_size)^.5 as lower_bound,
					 (treat_mean-control_mean)+ 1.96*(control_std^2/control_size+ treat_std^2/treat_size)^.5  as upper_bound FROM

(select AVG(outcome) as control_mean, STDEV(outcome) as control_std, count(*) as control_size from study where assignment=0)T1,

(select AVG(outcome) as treat_mean, STDEV(outcome) as treat_std, count(*) as treat_size from study where assignment=1)T2
