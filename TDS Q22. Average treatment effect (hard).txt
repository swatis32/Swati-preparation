22. Average treatment effect (hard)
From the following table summarizing the results of a study, calculate 
the average treatment effect as well as upper and lower bounds 
of the 95% confidence interval. Round these numbers to 3 decimal places.

Select  T.mean-C.mean as point_estimate, T.mean-C.mean - 1.96* sqrt (POW(T.stdev,2)/T.n + POW(C.stdev,2)/C.n) as upper_bound as lower_bound,
T.mean-C.mean + 1.96* sqrt (POW(T.stdev,2)/T.n + POW(C.stdev,2)/C.n) as upper_bound
