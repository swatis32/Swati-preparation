23. Rolling sum salary
The following table shows the monthly salary for an employee for the first 
nine months in a given year. From this, write a query to return a table that displays, 
for each month in the first half of the year, the rolling sum of the employeeâ€™s salary for 
that month and the following two months, ordered chronologically.


select distinct s1.month , s1.salary+s2.salary+s3.salary as salary_3_mos from salary s1, salary s2, 
									salary s3
							on ((s1.month=s2.month-1 and s2.month=s3.month-1) # s1, s2, s3
							or (s2.month=s1.month-1 and s1.month=s3.month-1)  # s2, s1, s3
							or (s3.month=s2.month-1 and s2.month=s1.month-1)) # s3, s2, s1
							and s1.month <=6
							order by s1.month


Method 2:
Select month, sum(salary) over(order by month ROWS BETWEEN CURRENT ROW and 2 FOLLOWING) as salary_3_months
