25. Retention curve (hard)
From the following user activity table, write a query to return the fraction of 
users who are retained (show some activity) a given number of days after joining. 
By convention, users are considered active on their join day (day 0)

### Key idea is combine tables user_id, dates, day_no X user_id, action_date
### the first table contains all combos of user_id and dates and day_no is the days from joining for each user_id

select day_one, count(*) as n_total , count(action_date) as n_active , n_total/n_active as retention from
(
select users.user_id, action_date, dates, day_no from users right join
(
select T2.user_id, T2.dates,(T2.dates-T3.action_date) as day_no from 
(
select distinct user_id, dates from users join
(
SELECT cast(generate_series(min(action_date), max(action_date), 
            '1 day'::interval) AS date) AS dates
FROM users 
)T1
)T2

left join
(select user_id, action_date as join date from users where action='Join')T3
on T2.user_id=T3.user_id
where day_one>=0
)
T4
on users.user_id=T4.user_id
and users.action_date=T4.dates
)T5
group by day_one
order by day_one
