From the following table, write a query to return, for each user, 
the date when they become a super user, ordered by oldest super users first. Users 
who are not super users should also be present in the table.

select distinct user_id, super_user_date  from users left join
(
select user_id, transaction_date as super_user_date from
	(select user_id, transaction_date, rank()over(partition by user_id order by transaction_date) as rnk)T1
where rnk=2
) T2
on users.user_id=T2.user_id
order by super_user_date
