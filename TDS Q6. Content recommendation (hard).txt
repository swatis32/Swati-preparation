6. Content recommendation (hard)
Using the following two tables, write a query to return page recommendations to a social media user based on the pages 
that their friends have liked, but that they have not yet marked as liked. Order the result by ascending user ID. 

select likes.user_id, friend_page_like from likes right join
(
select user_id, DISTINCT friend_page_like from

(select user_id,friend_id, page_like as friend_page_like from friends join likes
on friends.friends_id=likes.user_id) T1
group by user_id
)T2

on likes.user_id=T2.user_id
and likes.page_likes=T2.friend_likes
where likes.page_likes IS NULL
order by likes.user_id


New solution 3/7: 
----------------------
Select distinct user, friend_likes as recommended_page likes from

(Select user, page_likes as friend_likes
From friends join likes
On friends.friend=likes.user_id
) as friends_like_table

Where CONCAT(user,friend_likes) not in

(Select CONCAT(user, page_likes) from likes)
order by 1
