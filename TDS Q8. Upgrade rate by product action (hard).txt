8. Upgrade rate by product action (hard)
Given the following two tables, return the fraction of users, rounded to two 
decimal places, who accessed feature two (type: F2 in events table) 
and upgraded to premium within the first 30 days of signing up.


select ROUND(SUM(case when premium_date-join_date <30 then 1
		else 0 end)/count(*),2)
		as rate
FROM users join
(
select T1.user_id, premium_date from 

(select user_id, access_date as f2_date where type='F2') T1
left join
(select user_id, access_date as premium_date where type='P') T2
on T1.user_id=T2.user_id
)
T3
on users.user_id=T3.user_id

ANOTHER way!! 
-----------------------------------------
select ROUND(count(*)/ (select count(*) from users),2) as upgrade_rate from
(
(select user_id, (access_date-join_date) as F2_days from users join events
							on users.user_id=events.user_id
							where type='F2'
							and F2_days <=30
)T1

join
(
select user_id, (access_date-join_date) as P_days from users join events
							on users.user_id=events.user_id
							where type='P'
							and P_days <=30
)T2
on T1.user_id=T2.user_id
)T3

Method 3 most recent:
--------------------------------------------
Select ROUND(sum (case when DATED_DIFF(p_access_date, join_date)<30 then 1 else 0 end)/ (select count(*) from users),2)
FROM

(Select user_id, join_date, type , p_access_date from
Users join
Events on users.user_id=events.user_id
Where type in (‘P’)
) as p
 Join
(Select user_id, join_date, type , f2_access_date from
Users join
Events on users.user_id=events.user_id
Where type in (‘F2’)
)f2
On p.user_id=f2.user_id
