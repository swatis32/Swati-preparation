9. Most friended
Given the following table, return a list of users and their corresponding friend count. 
Order the result by descending friend count, and in the case of a tie, by ascending user ID. 
Assume that only unique friendships are displayed
(i.e., [1, 2] will not show up again as [2, 1] ). 


SELECT user_id, count(*) AS friend_count
FROM 
(
SELECT user1 AS user_id
FROM friends
UNION ALL
SELECT user2 AS user_id
FROM friends) t1
GROUP BY user_id
ORDER BY friend_count DESC, user_id ASC
