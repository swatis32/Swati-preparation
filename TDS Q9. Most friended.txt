9. Most friended
Given the following table, return a list of users and their corresponding friend count. 
Order the result by descending friend count, and in the case of a tie, by ascending user ID. 
Assume that only unique friendships are displayed
(i.e., [1, 2] will not show up again as [2, 1] ). 

Ans 1.
select COALESCE(T1.user1,T2.user2) as user , SUM(COALESCE(cnt1,0),COALESCE(cnt2,0)) as total  from

(select user1, count(*) as cnt1 from friends
group by user1
)T1
full outer join
(
select user2, count(*) as cnt2 from friends
group by user2
)T2
on T1.user1=T2.user2
order by total desc, user asc

Ans 2. Good!!
SELECT user_id, count(*) AS friend_count
FROM 
(
SELECT user1 AS user_id
FROM friends
UNION ALL
SELECT user2 AS user_id
FROM friends) t1
GROUP BY user_id
ORDER BY friend_count DESC, user_id ASC
